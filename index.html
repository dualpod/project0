        Washington (CNN)The Supreme Court on
        Thursday blocked the Trump administration's 
        attempt to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an
        Obama-era program that protects hundreds of 
        thousands of immigrants brought to the US as children from
        deportation.

        The 5-4 ruling was written by Chief Justice
        John Roberts and joined by Justices Ruth 
        Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan, Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor.
        In penning the opinion, Roberts once again
         sided with the liberals on the bench in a momentous dispute that will
        infuriate judicial conservatives who are 
        still bitter that he once provided the deciding vote to uphold
        Obamacare.
        The opinion is the second
        time in a week when the Supreme Court --
         bolstered with two of President Donald
          Trump's nominees -- has ruled
        against the Trump administration. Monday, 
        the court said LGBTQ Americans are protected under the Civil Rights
        Act.
